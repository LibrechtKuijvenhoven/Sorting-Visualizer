# Sorting Visualizer

Hi, welcome my sorting visualizer project. I wanted to take a look at how different sorting algotihms sort, and thought it would be a great project to visualise the algorithms. 

You can take a look at the website: [https://librechtkuijvenhoven.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer/](https://librechtkuijvenhoven.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer/)
